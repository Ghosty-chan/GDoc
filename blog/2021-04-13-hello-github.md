## Welcome to GDoc.

### ‚ùó‚ùó WIP ‚ùó‚ùó
[üåç GDoc on Github](https://github.com/Ghosty-chan/GDoc)

Feel free to help me improve this :)
<!--truncate-->

### It's public now!

I've made some basic changes, read some of the copyright & legal terms so far -
but tbh I'm not sure! So please if you notice that something isn't correct, inform me & I can take action! Thank you.
 need to append my name everywhere etc. but that's planned for now üòã

So far I'm trying to collect everything together including images, gifs, codes, notes, infos, etc.
While trying to figure out what to write where, to split or not to split - while reworking some base lines here like the Intro.

I'm not following any special roadmap or anything for now.
Doc Additions will be frequently, may or may not always with a blog to it.

### Docker possible
I've been able to deploy this live with Docker, so its easy to setup for everyone (atleast should? ü§£)

### Toolbox plans
With the endless possibilities I'm open with NodeJS, React & moar to create Browser Tools like:

- Color Palette
- "Todo List" with Extras
  - to keep track of resized props or Colors
- Simple Wire examples
- render EGP (have seen that actually.. hmm ü§î)
