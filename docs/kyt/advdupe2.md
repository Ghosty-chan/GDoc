## Overview

:::caution

Everything here is still work in progress

With that said, not everything will be here yet âš 

:::

### Not so hard if its filled

![List Menu Example](/gmod_img/kyt/ApplicationFrameHost_1PJbvEB8hD.png)

Yes, by creating a Ghost of your structure, you'll see what gets saved. *(If the ghost doesnt bug away)*

`Right Click` on your Constraption when its constrained together (welded, no-collided, etc.)

![Preview Ghost](/gmod_img/kyt/ApplicationFrameHost_kL1lBgR1Lc.png)

This Ghost contains (hopefully) all your props.. *better recheck on small stuff*

Now you can just add a new file to the filelist `(right click in the blank menu or on an folder)`

![Preview Save Contextmenu](/gmod_img/kyt/gmod_Q7c0GbFDlH.png)

Now there appeared two text boxes, one is the name - second just some description words for later


**That's it!**

### How to load?

Simple double click your file, wait till it loaded (watch the toolgun)
Then left click!
