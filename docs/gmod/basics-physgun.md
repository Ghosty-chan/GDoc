## Overview

The physgun brings the sandbox to life.
Well not only that we need to watch out for `Mingebags` throwing their props & vehicles at us!

**Most Server are against prop killing & pushing, and even more at other constructions**

You'll get the hang very quick

| Key |  | Function |  |
| :---: | --- | :---: | :---: |
|`Left Mouse`| |Moves Prop|
|`Right Mouse`| |Freezes Prop|
|`E (Use)`| |Rotate Prop|
|`Shift (Sprint)`| |snapping Angle Alignment|


### Rotating `without Shift`

(Mouse Up <-> Down)

(Mouse Left <-> Right)

### While Rotating it with `Shift` - makes it nearly perfect

### My Prop is way too fast moving away/closer
Console > `physgun_wheelspeed 10`

:::danger
**In most cases, when I see a faster movement; I pre-assume some prop pushing is gonna happen..**
