## Overview

**Build , Test & Create**

within the servers boundaries & rules.

otherwise your experience will end pretty fast



**Tools & Addons**

your best friend & enemy

'everything' or most of all is driven by lua inside Garry's mod

How does this help us? Well, you're not the first who likes to build 'something'

with Tools & Addons a server providing us, we can either extend our current construction
or make it even better. Some Tools may help us constructing it, some may be better todo another job like just coloring freshly spawned Props

### Addons

Most sandbox servers providing a server collection of all the workshop items your client will need ;)

If not feel free to contact & discuss it together! (for example in server public chat or discord)

Why? & How? [Please follow this Section of How to Install Collections](../basics-gmod-server)

- [ULX]
- [Wiremod]
- [WAC]
- [Advanced Duplicator 2]
- [SmartSnap]
- [Stacker]
- [Precision]
- [Precision Alignment]

... and so on


### Spawn Menu

> The Spawn Menu is being used to spawn props _\*ba dum tss\*_

But for way more than that. All we do & create starts here

To the left, we have all our `props` & their `spawnlists` - we can even create our own to keep track of our most favorite prop list! (or just some which are hidden)


### Tool Menu

On the right, we have a bunch of tools.. & some tabs to more tools?

Let's start with our first tab **Tools**

and we start with the base game tools provided by sandbox itself

- Weld
- Axis
- Ballsockets
- Hydraulics
- Elastics
- Ropes
- Winch
- Wheel
- Thrusters
- Lights
- _some ragdoll tools_
- Remover
- Color
- Material

well that was it kinda

with this we have atleast the basics to build something pretty cheap

but, once we start bringing it to life, you'll notice problems here & there. 

- Either you don't have enough keys to control it.. 
- or it just gets too much to control yourself. 
- Remembering wrong keys.. kills your mate? Damn not good. 
- Opening the front door instead of your safe bunker?
