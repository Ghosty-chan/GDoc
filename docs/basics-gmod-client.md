## Overview

Hello :)

## Legacy Addons

Are those ones, which are manually installed (from Github, etc.)
Most Useful if you wanna have the newest stuff in Singleplayer ;)
(more about that later on...)

## Workshop Addons

## Activate the Console!

![Enable Developer Console](/gmod_img/basics/menus/ApplicationFrameHost_j6zQtQeE1w.png)

Yes, my base-game is in german!

Below the options > keybinds - you find the developer console -

Press on Advanced & check the box! The hotkey should work now ingame.

(Due some weird gmod menu'ing, the console doesnt appear in mainmenu, except you're starting with the launchparameter `-console`)
