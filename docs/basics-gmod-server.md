## Overview

_Well like any other games_

- 🎩 **Respect** others _and they'll respect you!_
- 👀 Watch out for **others**, you don't like it too_
- 🌌 **Be Creative**, no-one needs to re-use stuff from others!
- 😈 **Listen** to others, don't be a jerk!
- 🛑 **LISTEN TO STAFF AND FOLLOW**_, they don't jail you for no reason atleast not on UB_
- 💡 Use your **common sense**

### Gamemodes
- [Sandbox](gmod/basics-gmod-sandbox)

### Addons

We split between
- [Legacy Addons](basics-gmod-client)
- [Workshop Addons](basics-gmod-client)

### Workshop Addons

*do I need to explain?* 😁

Basicly just don't get too much, but you need all the server has in use! Otherwise you'll see errors,

this can also happen when for example you join a server too fast, before all addons are loaded in mainmenu! _(me with 600 for example needs to wait some seconds.. on an M2 SSD...)_

#### How to Install Collections

Steam Overlay | Browser to Workshop Link (found in motd)

## Joining the Server

so far you should have done that by yourself 🚀
Good Job! so far ;)

### Loadingscreen

![Loadingscreen](/gmod_img/servers/gmod_loading.jpg)

Already here we gain the most important things:

- Basic Rules
- Which Gamemode
- Which map
- _(What to kinda expect?)_

We can gain some ideas by the images provided, and any view of how this can look here!

Nice! But I'm only here to fight!

## Rules & Motd

![Motdscreen](/gmod_img/servers/gmod_7GnnTWUWGG.png)

Oh, finally! **READ THIS ATLEAST BRIEFLY**

### **❗ 🛑 STOP ❗**

**take a second & just try to fly over the so called 'motd'**

First time here?


Let's consider to split up this mess a bit:

We have:
- What they are
- Oh **reporting some player** who breaks the rules!
- **Rules Small but longer than before**
- **Addons!**
- War Rules? more rules? hmm (+ scrolling)

### Common Sense (Nr. 1)

Combined with all this information,

⛔ we can spawn & finally kill someone right?

**NO** don't! Look around, turn around - in spawn.

Are there any rules? Any notes? Chat?

## First Steps

On UB, we do have a so called **'buildzone'** which can be easily teleported into **only from Spawnzone**

& Additional text flying around the Spawnzone on `gm_flatgrass`

and like I said the teleporter to the buildzone ✨
